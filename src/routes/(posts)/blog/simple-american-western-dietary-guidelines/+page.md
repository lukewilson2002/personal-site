# Simple American Western-Dietary Guidelines

- "Processed" isn't always bad; how else do you expect food to be shelf stable?
- Whole- or multi-grain bread is best -- avoid white bread.
- Limit *added sugars*. Natural sugars are fine. (<50g added sugar/day is best)
- Use the Yuka app while shopping to look for foods 50-100 or higher. But keep in mind: activity > whole foods > avg. grocery store purchase > fast food > snacks, white bread, ice cream, etc.
- 60g of protein daily (or more), but even 30g is fine some days.
- If trying to lose weight, track every meal's calories. Look up "caloric density of foods". More calories often means **more hunger**.
- Use whey protein powder to reach protein goals as a supplement.
- Don't rely heavily on liquid calories, they're not as filling!
- Take a multivitamin + Omega 3 supplement (NOT OMEGA 6 in a western diet!) + Magnesium after meal if active.
- Use intermittent fasting to help lose weight. 12-16hr fasting window is highly effective.
- Breaking the rules and tricking your body is good sometimes.
- If you do cardio, workout before, this removes the glycogen from the muscles, which burns more fat during the cardio portion. You may hate it though.
- In a perfect world, all meals revolve around a lean protein source and contain vegetables, brown rice, fruit, etc.
- There are two primary goals in choosing what to eat: getting essential and non-essential amino acids (helps with a plethora of conditions), and consuming only the calories you need.
- A meal is around 500-900 calories and satisfying for hours! If you are still hungry after, then the food may not be nutritional enough. Reconsider what you are eating, is it calorically dense? Does it leave you craving more food afterwards? How many calories of this food does it take you to feel completely full?
- Cooking oils are very calorically dense, so don't fry if you're limiting calories.
- Your health is the average of your: physical activity, diet, sleep, stress, and happiness.
- Your diet is the average of your good days, and the days you do bad.
- Forward progress isn't about perfection, but making the average of your choices good ones.
